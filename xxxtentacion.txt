 [Speech: XXXTentacion]
Okay, so it's recording, it's recording now.
It's 8:31 AM and I am currently talking to my laptop and I don't exactly know how to have a conversation with my laptop while I'm by myself
So this is gonna be, um how do you call it, a try?
Um, so here we go.
So I'm pretty sure we have a lot of SoundCloud fans that actually don't have a Twitter, Tumblr, or an Instagram or anything such as that.
Cause I'm sure that a lot of you just discovered my music through SoundCloud and probably don't know how to get in contact with me.
So here's how we're gonna, here's how we're gonna keep in contact for those of you that actually, like diehard fans.
Cause I'm pretty sure a lot of our diehard fans don't have the main social networks.
So what I want you guys to do is either download Tumblr, Twitter, Instagram, or maybe even Snapchat.
And I'm gonna give you each of my names and I'm gonna put em in the, in the description and I'm gonna put my partners' names and I'm gonna, like different, different people that I'm working with
or whatever you guys want from me.
I'm gonna start answering questions through Tumblr so if you wanna get in contact with me to have a conversation, you're gonna contact me through Tumblr.
If you want to, I mean just look at what the fuck I'm thinking and have a comment on what I'm thinking, that would usually be on Twitter.
Um, Instagram obviously is just, just photos
I mean the extent to it's just a DM, I see pretty much where I check is the DM's is why I go on Instagram. So if you wanna get in contact with me, again, Instagram.
My, I'll give you contact to my manager so that way you can contact my managers easier if you have a line of business that you want to contact me for. Please only contact if it is for business.
What, I mean as far as the shows we have, what's the shows we have coming up?
We have one in West Palm, West Palm Beach on Friday with Wifisfuneral.
And then I have a, I have a show with my partner the day after and also with my partner Pollari, Kevin Pollari.
I mean if you wanna come to those shows, those are the dates.
Friday, West Palm Beach, myself and Wifisfuneral.
And Saturday, I'll be attending my partner's show in, what is it, Miami?
Well, so yeah it's in Wynwood, Miami.
So what I need you guys to do is go on our social networks and follow us.
So for Twitter, my social network name would be what my artist name is on SoundCloud.
X-X-X-T-E-N-T-A-C-I-O-N
For, I'll give you Instagram, for Instagram: heroinfather, H-E-R-O-I-N-F-A-T-H-E-R
For Snapchat, theheroinfather, T-H-E-H-E-R-O-I-N-F-A-T-H-E-R
Tumblr, xxxtentacion.tumblr.com, so X-X-X-T-E-N-T-A-C-I-O-N, dot tumblr, T-U-M-B-L-R, dot com.
And, um, I'm pretty sure that'd be it.
Alright, well, on a different note, here's what I'll cover. We'll call it "a helping hand."
Damn, I gotta get in my feelings I guess.
For those of you that I guess feel misguided or feel, what would the word be?
A little bit not in tune with what's going on around you and you feel confused, you feel like you're just following whatever is right in front of you
Here's what I call a helping hand, here's how I'll help you do it:
With whatever you apply your attention to is which direction your life will go in.
So say for instance you see money in your life and that's what you want more of.
The more you apply your attention towards money is the more it will appear.
The more you apply your attention towards bad things in your life, the more it will appear.
The more you apply your attention, such as the good things in your life, the more it will appear.
People think that people such as DJ Khaled, or like people that are successful maybe people like Kanye.
Or these bigger artist, they see them as crazy because of what they display and that they display it so simple, but it's literally what it is.
So, the key to success would be more success. The more you apply your attention towards your success.
The more you apply your attention to the good things around you, the more you apply your attention to the things that you want in your life is the more it appears.
And that, there's no other way to actually say that, so for those of you that feel like you've been thrown into some sort of disarray.
[glitch]
Woah, did it pause? Oh, well no it didn't pause.
Yeah, for those of you that are kind of like lost in space in your mind, just understand that your attention is important.
Whatever you, whatever you, how do I put it?
What you want will appear if you surround yourself with it.
So if you want that brand new car, surround yourself with success, surround yourself with money so this car will eventually pop up.
There's no simpler way-holy shit.
Shouts out to Teflon Sean.
You need to make a, need to make a SoundCloud, Teflon.
But yeah, also, study the Golden Beetle.
With that being said, goodbye.




 [Intro]
There was blood in my tears
"I don¡¯t know why you¡¯re doing it but it¡¯s not good and it¡¯s not healthy- it¡¯s not right."
I heard so many complaints to remember
"Not that I¡¯m saying you don¡¯t have it together, I¡¯m sure you do. You¡¯re a genius, you really are."
I will never change
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Break!
Yeah (she said, she said)
Yeah

[Verse]
If the seasons change
Will you remain the same?
Oh, how I love the cold
Because of you I'll never know
Gold teeth in a flask (yeah)
Many men without a soul
But the fall is all we know, yeah it's all we know
I look forward to the ghost
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Break
I will never change, I will never break, yeah
Break, yeah
I will never change, I will never break
Break, yeah
I will never change, I will never break, yeah
Break, yeah
I will never change, I will never break
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
I don't wanna be alone
Please, I don't wanna be alone
Please, I don't wanna be alone (be alone)
Please, I don't wanna be alone (wanna be alone, wanna be alone)
Yeah
"...a genius"
"I know"




 [Intro]
I've had enough of this, goodbye

[Hook]
Rape victim, slay victim, take victim
Rape victim, slay victim, take victim
Rape victim, slay victim, take victim
Rape victim, slay victim, take victim

[Verse 1]
I woke up with the knife in my hand, aye, aye
To murder the bitch was the plan, aye, aye
I will never salvage, feelings are abundant
Many men are of a dying breed
Plunge a knife into his throat
And suck the blood of human out in case it's dangerous

[Verse 2]
I observe the father, walk into an alley
Probably going just to take a piss
Slowly, surely, I will take position
Without hesitation, I will grab his wrists
Chop him, buck him, fuck him
I will stab him, splat him, drag his body all across the map
Shower in his fluids, kiss him, bite him, eat him
Threw a fit, and then I take a nap

[Bridge]
Butterflies, kidney stones
Slit wrists, vagabond
Concubine, I'm alone
Very holy when I'm not alone
Butterflies, kidney stones
Slit wrists, vagabond
Concubine, I'm alone
Very holy when I'm not alone

[Outro]
Very holy when I'm not alone
Very holy when I'm not alone
Very holy when I'm not alone
Very holy when I'm not alone
Very holy when I'm not alone
Very holy when I'm not alone
Very holy when I'm not alone




 [Intro]
I can't seem to find someone's shoulder
Who will I rely on when it's over?
Took a chance with you, it made me colder
Better on my own when it's all over

[Verse]
So when I'm weak, who do I call?
My God, it hurts, I can't be calm
What do I do? Where do I run?
I'm tired of hate, I'm tired of love
I dug my nails into my arms
She turned and laughed at all my scars
What is my worth?
What is my worth?

[Outro]
Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet
She turned and left I question, "What's my worth?"
Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet
She turned and left I question, "What's my worth?"
My worth, my worth




 [Verse]
I dream so much
And I just can't seem to find an answer
To what I'm looking for, in general
I can't keep living like this
It's breaking my heart, day by day
I mean, who's to say...
Who's to say you find an answer when living?
What if you just die?
What if life as we know it is all a game?
What if we live for no reason?
What if you just disappear when you die?
Should I cling to life
Or should I just kill myself?
So many contradictions, contemplations
It's getting harder and harder to mask my pain
I can't tell if I wanna live or if I wanna die
Please, save me




 [Verse]
Said you wanna take my bitch, no way
Yeah you silly damn I'm pissed, yeah
Really might fuck your bitch
Fuck her right and I fucking money dance in her clit
You got Chanel on your choker
Say "X boy your dick is a cobra"
I'm gon' fuck your friends girl I told ya'
I'm gon' fuck your friends girl I told ya'
Just might
Get your skeet for the night, just might
Mix lean with the sprite, just might
Get your skeet for the night, just might
Mix lean with the sprite, bitch
God damn bars set in, I can't walk now
All that shit that you was talking boy what's up now?
Got all these slits upon my wrist like Amy Winehouse
Who gon' fuck me, yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
I don't get mad, no more
I just fuck harder and harder and
I don't get mad, no more
I just fuck harder and harder and
I don't get mad, no more
I just fuck harder and harder and harder and harder and harder and

[Outro]
God damn
God damn
God damn

I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty
I know you're somewhere, somewhere
I've been trapped in my mind girl, just holding on
I don't wanna pretend there's something, we're nothing
I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold back
I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been tripping 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer and nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fucking end it
Pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm digging
Having conversations about my haste decisions
Fucking sickening
At the same time, memory surfaced through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playing with a slipknot
Post traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since a couple months they had a nigga locked up
I be feeling pain, I be feeling pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I be feeling pain, I be feeling pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I know you so well, I know you well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty
Depression and obsession don't mix well
I'm poisoned and my body don't feel well
I hate her, it's hard to love how I feel my stomach turning
Make out hill, where we met
We let our lips do all the talking and now I'm nothing
Depression and obsession don't mix well
Hollywood motels
Hell, I think I'm just obsessed with you
Depression and obsession don't mix well
Hollywood motels
Hell, I think I'm just obsessed with you

Don't go, don't go to sleep
Don't go, stay up and don't go
Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the night time
Only time I feel pain, when I'm feelin' love
That's why it's tatted on my face that I'm damn numb
Only time I'm in my mind, when I'm all alone
That's why I'm really never alone in the night time
Change hoes like clothes, I can't get attached
'Cause these hoes fire starters like lit matches
I've been feeling really lost, ducking all attachments
I don't really go outside 'cause I hate traffic
I don't wanna go outside, get caught in traffic
Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the night time
