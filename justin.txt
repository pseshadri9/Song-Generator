Lost time is never found, can the DJ please reverse it?
In life we pay for change, let's make every second worth it
Anything can work if you work it

The wrong thing, they be worrying about
Ooh you know females and how they like to run they mouths

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna be, wanna be just like talk like, you

Misery, misery loves company
Don't let 'em change your mood

[Chorus]
They try to get at me (they try to get at me)
Behind your back (your back, your back, your back)
They tryna tell me that I'm just like the others

I ain't that bad, all bad all bad
I might make you mad, so mad, my bad

[Verse 2]
Between us, they wanna come in

Perfect, ain't saying that I am
Proven, at least I've proven that I give a damn

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna be, wanna be everything I oughta be
To you to you, to you
Envy, envy, same thing as jealousy
Jealous of you

 [Intro]
Don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

[Verse 1]
If you got a twenty for all of your tries
Twenty for all of the times
The times you got back up, woah
Could be a billionaire in a year
That's how you gotta think 'til you're there
On the regular

[Pre-Chorus]
If you had a diamond for all of your passion
Diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like caking
Icy for every occasion
Gotta go hard, yeah
That's all I'm condoning
Love is a component
You¡¯re the only opponent
Gotta seize the moment

[Chorus]
And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Come again each time
'Til the water runs dry
Oh don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

[Post-Hook]
Oh, oh
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
If I had a guitar missing 5 strings
A guitar with only one string
I could only play one song, ooh
A simple melody
Simple enough to make the world sing
Strong enough to make your mood swing
You know what I mean

[Pre-Chorus]
If you had a diamond for all of your passion
Diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like caking
Icy for every occasion
Gotta go hard, yeah
That's all I'm condoning
Love is a component
You're the only opponent
Gotta seize the moment

[Chorus]
And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it

Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

[Post-Hook]
Oh, oh
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

All in it, all in it

[Vamp]
See, growing up, I
I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
Cause I, I just didn't think I was good enough
And, and maybe if I was good at something that I'd get recognition from that but
I quickly found out that I wasn't gonna get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed because
Because people aren't perfect and by not being perfect you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God it's like he's perfect
And he never disappoints
So I just get my recognition from him
And give him recognition




 [Intro: Justin Bieber]
I just can't wait, yeah

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
I don't want a lot for Christmas, there is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas Day

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, you, baby

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas, I won't even wish for snow
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Cause baby all I want for Christmas is you, you baby

[Bridge: Justin Bieber & Mariah Carey]
Oh-ho, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere
And the sound of children laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing, I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need? Won't you please bring my baby to me? Yeah

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Justin Bieber]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby, yeah
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want you for my own, for my own baby
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is you baby

[Outro until Fade: Justin Bieber]
It's all I want for Christmas baby
It's all I want for Christmas
It's all I want baby, yeah yeah
Woah, woah woah woah woah, ooh baby




 [Verse 1]
Sitting here, all alone watching the snow fall
Looking back at the days when we threw them snow balls
I can't believe I'm putting the tree up by myself
I need you and nobody else

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm sorry if I pushed you away
Cause I need you here and I want for you to know

[Chorus]
And I don't care, if I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas
I'm sorry if I hurt you but I know that
All I want is you this Christmas

[Verse 2]
And I never wanna do this alone
Baby I just need you to be here, here through the holidays, yeah
I just wanna know if you feel same way
Because I'm lonely baby, want you to hold me baby

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm sorry if I pushed you away
I just want you to know I miss you and I want you to stay

[Chorus]
And I don't care, if I don't get anything
Al I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas
I'm sorry if I hurt you but I know that
All I want is you this Christmas

[Bridge]
Wrapping gifts without you babe's like mid-December
And there's no cold, I can't do this on my own
I've changed my ways
Keep running back and forth again, I'm here to stay, yeah

[Chorus]
And I don't care, if I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas
I'm sorry if I hurt you but I know that

[Outro]
All I want is you this Christmas

 [Verse 1]
Oh-oh, just as sure as the stars in the sky
I need you to shine in my life
Not just for the meanwhile, for a long long time
Better believe it
Oh-oh, whenever you're not in my presence
It feels like I'm missing my blessings, yeah
So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night
'Til you're back again, oh yeah, yeah
You think I'm biased, to my significant other
You hit it right on the head, only been missing my lover
Got a whole lot of texts in my phone and I don't reply
But the next eight bars tell you why

[Chorus]
You're all that matters to me, yeah yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If I ain't with you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me, yeah yeah
What's a king bed without a queen?
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me

[Verse 2]
Take the gas out the car, it won't drive
That's how I feel when you're not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you
And only you
Oh-oh, I'm grateful for your existence
Faithful no matter the distance
You're the only girl I see
From the bottom of my heart, please believe

[Chorus]
You're all that matters to me, yeah yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If I ain't with you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me, yeah yeah
What's a king bed without a queen?
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me

 [Verse 1]
We were inseparable
Everything I had to do, I did it next to you
And the memories we made were so incredible
Then our love was interrupted by my schedule

[Pre-Chorus]
There was nothing that I could do
Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
And your heart filled up with so much aggression baby, you got used to

[Chorus]
Being alone, alone
You adapted, now you're used to
Being alone, all alone
Ooh you got used to being on your own

[Verse 2]
I saw it happening
But I didn't accept the truth, I couldn't fathom it
There was so much going on you couldn't handle it
Could have divided my time, I should have rationed it

[Pre-Chorus]
There was nothing that I could do
Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
And your heart filled up with so much aggression baby, you got used to

Being alone, alone
You adapted, now you're used to
Being alone, all alone
Ooh you got used to being on your own

As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love me

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Oh, woah
Oh, woah
Oh, woah

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I¡¯ll be there
You want my love, you want my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We¡¯re just friends, what are you saying?
Said "There¡¯s another," and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like...

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you¡¯d always be mine, mine

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Oh, for you I would have done whatever
And I just can¡¯t believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losing you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby, fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can¡¯t believe my first love won¡¯t be around, and I'm like...

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you¡¯d always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you¡¯d always be mine, mine

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
(Luda)
When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, no one could ever come above
She had me going crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don¡¯t need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really want to see her on the weekend
She knows she's got me dazing, cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking, but I just keep on saying

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you¡¯d always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you¡¯d always be mine, mine

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
I'm gone, yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm all gone, yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm all gone, yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm all gone, gone, gone, gone, I'm gone




 [Verse 1]
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I'll be there
You want my love, you want my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We're just friends, what are you saying
Say there's another and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time and I was like

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

[Verse 2]
Oh for you, I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I gotta play it cool, cause I'm losing you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
Cause I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around and I'm like

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

[Verse 3]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm 16, and I thought that you'd be mine
I used to tweet you and text you and call you and hit you on Facebook all the time
But but but now you're gone, so far long that I can't even find you
You know that feeling when you leave your love and it's right behind you
Can't believe that you did me wrong, we were on iChat all night long
Listening to our favourite song, she was wrong, I am gone
I thought I loved her, never but no one above her
Yes she was my lover, but now until another like

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

[Outro]
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm all gone, gone, gone
I'm gone




 [Intro]
Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down and get closer to you
Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down and get closer to you

[Verse 1]
Get a little closer to me too
I get a little shy when we start to move
I get a little high when I'm tryna decide if it's London or China too
Forget about the plans that you got, baby
Kiss me like you can't have too many
The Earth is like 'round and 'round we go
When it's gon' stop, you never know

[Pre-Chorus]
So in the meantime, I'm living and I'm gonna love
Because you choose me, I'm walkin' cloud 9 above

[Chorus]
Baby's in love
Baby's on top, never gon' stop to get what she wants
Whatever she want, givin' it up, 'cause baby's in love
Baby don't need anything more than just what I got
Baby's in love

[Hook]
Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down and get closer to you
Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down and get closer to you

[Verse 2]
Get a little excited from across the room
I just can't seem to keep my eyes off you
Smile at me, so I smile at you
Then you feel so loved, when I dance with you
Tonight the way that you're moving
Make me wanna lose it
Round and 'round we go
When it's gon' stop, you never know

[Pre-Chorus]
So in the meantime I'm living, and I'm gonna love
Because you choose me, I'm walkin' cloud 9 above

[Chorus]
Baby's in love
Baby's on top, never gon' stop to get what she wants
Whatever she want, givin' it up, 'cause baby's in love
Baby don't need anything more than just what I got
Baby's in love

[Hook]
Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down and get closer to you
Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down and get closer to you
